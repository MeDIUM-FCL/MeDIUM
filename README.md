Measurement Data Interpretation using Uncertain Models (MeDIUM) software

Download the folder and double click on the MeDIUM.exe file to run the software. Depending upon the computerâ€™s security settings, Windows defender /firewall may block the software from running as its downloaded from the internet. The executable works only on a windows machine.

The software enables use of error-domain model falsification (EDMF), a data interpretation methodology, for structural and geotechnical applications.

Included in the dowload in the Tutorial folder are following files:
1.	MeDIUM_Help.docx
2.	Measurements(Structural).xlsx
3.	InitialModelSet(Structural).xlsx
4.	Uncertainties(Structural).xlsx
5.	Measurements(Geo).xlsx
6.	InitialModelSet(Geo).xlsx
7.	Uncertainties(Geo).xlsx

These files could be used as inputs to test the software. These files could also be modified by the user with necessary data to perform analysis of new case studies.

The source files are available in the src folder for reference.

In case of any questions, suggestions and errors, kindly contact Sai G.S. Pai (saiganesh89@gmail.com).
